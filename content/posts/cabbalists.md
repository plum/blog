Cabbalists try to get people, especially Christians nowadays, to learn their numerology mumbo jumbo in order to mislead them; so the short answer is, it depends if your calculaitons are in arabic numerals, or hebrew. Cabbalists become unstuck with that one. 11 cannot signify two pillars.  It signifies just 1 + 1 + 1 +  1 + 1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 + 1 .    Numerical concepts depend  only on ones (never zeros) . As concepts, they are baseless and signify nothing.  God has no need to count. He
sees everything
and understands knows all without an abacus.  He speaks directly without language, and may also employ human language. Why would he spek in  numbers?  Symbols don't live, don't exist. Everything created living thing is unique life. Forms may be speak 'symbolicaly'  like 'down' or 'up'  and so forth, to you, and as in dreams.That's as far as it goes. If symbols were a universal language, dreams wouldn't need interpreting in the waking state. They would be self-apparent.
