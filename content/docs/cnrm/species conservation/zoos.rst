Consider...
===========

* Role in linking in situ and ex situ conservation.
* Challenge posed by expanding human and declining wildlife population and eco systems.
* Conservation of wildlife requires mutually reinforcing links between in situ and ex situ conservation recognised by the convention on biological diversity e.g. for critically small population fragments.
* Insufficient knowledge for many species to determine the extent of extinction risk, or informed management decisions.
* Research is integral to development of recovery plans and management of sustainable populations.
* Zoos as High technology germ plasm banks:
    * gene banks including semen, ova, fertilised embryos, somatic cells and DNA collections
    * increases options for future conservation action (Ryder &Feistner 1995)
* Public expectations of seeing charismatic animals.
* Limitations of space
* Financial resources.
* Only a small proportion of vertebrate taxa will be included in zoos (Soule et al., 1986)
* What is a good zoo?


Messages from Zoos
==================
* Zoo professionals regard themselves as stewards rather than masters of nature.
* But a distance exists between zoo animals and visitors.
* The message zoos wish to convey should be clear* e.g. global or local; relevant to local zoo visitors.
* Messages as issues, problems or neutral subjects. What is the zoo trying to achieve.
* Message effective when considering cultural norms of the audience.
* Transmission of messages: variety of methods; species choice for exhibition, exhibit design as eco-system, brochures, scientific reports, graphics, audio-visual interactive, signs, labels, talks etc.
* total ambience of a conservation concious organisation: contradictory messages - look in the cafes at the packaging. Practise what you preach.
* Crucial to know whether the messages are received
* Most people still visit zoos for recreation. Is this compatible?


Research in zoos
================
* Identification of species or sub-species for conservation management (Ryder, 1986) benefits from genetic techniques e.g. Orang-u-tang (Jancie Wiczi et al., 1990)
* Early taxonomic and anatomical research carried out in zoos.
* Comparative studies of behaviour, reproductive physiology and evolutionary genetics.
* e.g. Sex determination in many reptiles is influenced by egg-incubation temperature.
* Are the Wild Asses of Mongolia different from those of Tibet?
* Zoos have been criticised, they are willing, but what is their effective role?
* Geneticists emphasise research; but PVA's uncertainty point to need for habitat management
* The idea that technology will conserve but not ecosystem maybe deviates from urgency required in protecting landscapes now
* Research is feasible  in a wild setting. Monitoring reintroductions is at least as informative, and offers captives for tissue samples.
* Determination of gestation length requires knowledge of timing. But oestrous cycles etc. are interrupted in captivity.
* Ability to establish the composition of groups: social behaviour affected by captivity (density dependent).
* New technologies should compliment direct observation of animal behaviour
* Behavioural research limited in zoos
* When is a zoo not a zoo? Is a reserve a zoo? Let's say no it isn't Reason language

* Reproductive events increasingly monitored non-invasively - understanding the sociobiology (Klieman, 1980)
* Contributes to greater breeding success ex situ e.g. Cheetah, density and smell. Scent marks and spatial distribution.
* Non-invasive genetic sampling of wild populations uses the  polymerase chain reaction: (slime, hair, epithelium in faeces; Woodruff 1989).


Species in Zoos
===============
* Current priorities stress the importance of large vertebrates,
    * they are less likely to breed well than smaller organisms, more costly to maintain in long term breeding programmes.
* Zoos aren't targeting species for which habitat availability makes reintroduction a realistic prospect
* Imaginative exhibits of smaller animals can increase zoo attendance (Yajima 1991)
* Should target species threatened by factors other than irreversible habitat loss.
* No evidence that existing programmes focus on taxa that face threats other than irreversible habitat loss (Balmford et al., 1995).
* Potentially rewarding but neglected groups are invertebrates, fish, amphibians and reptiles.
* Among mammals, fast breeding social species such as bats.
* Displaying a more representative sample of fauna diversity will provide zoos with a more balanced framework for biodiversity education, and improve the welfare of animals in captivity.
* If biological requirements cannot be met in captivity, ex situ breeding is ethically unacceptable.
* Rhinos are given high priority for ex situ conservation (Foose, 1993), yet they are notoriously poor breeders in zoos.
* The Black-Footed Ferret breeding programme (Mustela nigripes) has been remarkably successful in biological terms, a good basis for reintroduction, all within the local area (Miller et al., 1994)
* Field Crickets in the London Zoo (Gryllus campestris), which has significantly contributed to their recovery programme.


Education and Zoos
==================
* Importance of conservation and biodiversity in education  (Whitehead et al 1995).
    * Outlined in Agenda 21 and the global biodiversity strategy, at the 1992 UNCED in Rio de Janero.
    * Depends on answering certain criticisms: behavioural distortion, ecological context and people/animal relationships.
* Zoos are the only institutions to keep living wild animals from all over the world.
* Since policy makers activists cannot reduce biodiversity loss without wider public support, a multi-faceted effort is required to expand public awareness
* estimated 600 million, 10% of global human population, visit the worlds 1000 plus federated zoos each year (WZCS).
* Film makers use zoos for close ups
* Various target audiences
* Contributions to formal school education from art through to zoology
* tertiary education: training programmes.
* Outcomes should be memorable compared to classrooms
* Zoos reflect the power of people over other sentient beings
* Distortions of behaviour: some species more than others
* Natural behaviour patterns: facilitated by good practise in husbandry, welfare and enclosure design
* Enclosures that reflect the faunal and floral bio diversity of eco systems, holistic displays, is a trend.
* e.g. Coimbatore Zoological Park offers visitors a chance to take a potted walk through the Nilgiri Hills. Also takes in culture of local people working in traditional crafts (Rangaswami & Walker, 1992).
* In a sense zoos are becoming bigger as the wild shrinks. Actually this is a zoo and a reserve joined together, reflecting local conservation aims.


Captive-breeding
================
* A vital role for in-situ conservation (Alney et al.,1994):
* exhibition of flagship species, public education, training
* fundraising events
* internationally coordinated Captive breeding programmes.
* Many are evolving into conservation centres (Rabb, 1994).
* Zoos can help conserve only a small minority of the species threatened with extinction (Balmford et al., 1995)
* Clear criteria are needed to identify which taxa zoos should focus on.
* Criteria should reflect the economic and biological realities of captive breeding and reintroduction
    * Preferences of zoo visitors indicate they need not adversely affect zoo attendance
* Advantages associated with small size could be compromised because their shorter generations would lose genetic variability more quickly.
* Small species must be maintained in larger captive populations than bigger taxa (Soule et al., 1986)
* The notion of zoos as arks has been amended
    * Long term captives are unlikely ever to be returned to the wild.
* Captive breeding aimed at reintroduction has a greater impact because it helps to restore eco systems, and frees resources for more efforts.


Questions
=========
* Q. Can In situ management of populations shed light on management of habitats and natural ecosystems?
* Q. Do zoos help progress in conservation science in the field? Many genetic samples and studies taken from zoos.


Conclusion
==========
* Optimise resource use
* minimise duration of each programme
* address the needs of more species
* conserve maximum biodiversity through conservation of landscapes
* we will save what we value.
* Genetic fine tuning should follow habitat availability.
* Genetic factors do not figure amongst the causes of extinction.
