Species Conservation
--------------------
One of the main players, legally and conceptually in conservation is the species.    

* Convention on International Trade in  Endangered Species (CITES).
* US. Endangered Species  Act (ESA).
* Conservation effort from fund-raising to to recovery programmes and reserve design, dewell on species.

The typological viewpoint follows Plato's view of species as representations of eternal types (eidos), or, species as  immutable creations of God. Individual variation is viewed as unimportant or unfortunate imperfections of the material world. 

Most of us have an intuitive feeling for species. Definition of the species is problematic, and species are viewed various ways. Ambiguity in species stems from the fact that the biological world is a continuium of organisation, from atoms to through cells,organs, individuals, communities, populations, and landscapes. Geographic variation in features may be well-marked and used as a basis for subspecies designations. Less obvious but perhaps more important differences may go unrecognized.

* Biodiversity is not the same as species diversity.
* Biological varatiation within species is important.
* Distinctions exist between bioogical and legal definitions of species.
* Populations and landscapes may be more significant or practical concerns as  levels of bbiological organisation.
* Asexual reproduction challenges the concept of individual (eg worms and lizards; rhizomatic plants).
* Species represent either evoloutionary continuity, that can interbreed. Also a level of discontinuity (eg ducks and Green woodpeckers). What of Mallard Ducks (Anas platyrynchos) and Mexican Duck (Anas diazi), which sometimes interbreed? 
* Distinctness and fixity are central features of the typological viewpiont.
* The populational view recognizes that species c omprise a group expresssing morphological, physiological and behavioural variation, the basis of evoloutionary change and adaptation.
* Overlap of traits  may exist betwenn geographically isolated populations.
* Geographic variation may reflect local adaptation; is this a step towards speciation? 


Reintoduction
-------------

Outcome of reintroduction depends on case specifics, 

* Biological and anthropological factors, including diet and life history 
* Number of animals released 
* Duration of release and level of organisational commitment
* Success may vary with time elapsed between capture and release
* Availability of suitable habitat is the strongest determinant of success (Griffith et al., 1989)
