Through my tutors, I have developed courage to look beyond my own enjoyment of Welsh uplands, to connect land to people. Sometimes I find that hard to do when I look, and see distant markets standing between the two. It is great to find people who understand how we have got where we are, and why the land is, as it is. I wonder who knows how it is to become?

   I have no vision of utopia, but I have a happy vision in which the land teems with wildlife. I only wish that more people could stay in farming, and trade locally. To work together, play together, and work less hard, with time to do what rural people have always done: Make merry.
