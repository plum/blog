WebQ is a JavaScript application for Q-sorting questionnaire items online.

Note, however, that the current version packaged as 'webqnew.zip' is not
yet documented on the WebQ Homepage. The prior version as packaged in
webq.zip is working fine, however, best only with Netscape that correctly 
supports the "extended mailto:" construct.


The WebQ Sample intro file is
