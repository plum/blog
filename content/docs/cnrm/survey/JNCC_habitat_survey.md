JNCC habitat mapping is a rapid though fairly detailed mapping of vegetation habitats on the ground.

   Fig: Sketch map, survey area, Mynndd Llangednai


Access
------
Restricted to paths. Varied vantage points were selected to map the area. Distances were gauged by pacing.

Soil
----
Brown earth, podzoidal, thin. Rocks break upon surface in places. Cambrian age sedimentary mudstone, and siltstone.

Boundaries
----------
Upper slope boundary adjacent to conifer plantation, including some deciduous trees. Some stone walls. Semi-improved grassland at lower northern boundary. Well marked pathways at edge, indicating frequent or habitual use. Nearby small settlements and farm houses. Springs at the edge of boundaries.

Features
--------
*Sheep and ponies.* One grazing pony visible. Narrow animal track running through the N. W. corner and occupying 3-4% of area. Apparently a sheep track.

*Other small trees and shrubs,* close to quadrat; Hawthorn, Sycamore and Sloe. These indicate succession of invasive scrub, and possibly associated species.


Vegetation Sampling, Mynydd Llangedai
=====================================
Method
------
10 metre square and larger homogeneous vegetation habitats were recorded. Ecotones not surveyed.

This NVC survey was conducted according to the methodology described in Rodwell, 1998.  Our group was split into 5 teams and each team surveyed one quadrat  each on three types of vegetation cover. We endeavoured to survery only homogeneous vegetation and avoid edge areas (ecotones),  where vegetation is beginning to change into a different phytosociological community. Where it was felt that the quadrat may not fully represent the vegetation type additional notes were recorded, according to features present, or adjoining vegetative cover.

Management Notes, Mynydd Llangedai
==================================

The Mynydd Llangedai Common is small, possibly a  fragmented remnant. Scrub invasion indicates reduced use as a grazed heath in the past fifty years. Bracken indicates former woodland. The adjacent  conifer woodland appears to have been replanted, containing some deciduous species.
