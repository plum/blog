Case studies from the Himalayan mountains in which the potential of sustainable tourism as a means to help safeguard rural communities is discussed.


Introduction
============
Environmental Conservation is Cultural Conservation.

	"Tourism is a very dynamic industry. It is a goose that lays golden eggs if it is properly managed. Otherwise it also fouls its own nest." ~ (Chandra Gurung)

The present essay focuses on communities inhabiting Himalayan mountains, where tourism poses threats to sustainability due to a fragile environment and indigenous human culture. Nepal provides a number of interesting case studies. Eighty-two percent of an rising population in Nepal works in agriculture. The 1959 closure of Nepal/Tibet border destroyed traditional trade routes and induced migration from Tibet. Tourism is now seen as significantly contributing to the economy of Nepal. As many as Eighty- percent of 270,000 international tourists in Nepal could have engaged in some form of permit-based trekking in 1991, concentrated within the regions of Annapurna, Khumbu and Langtang Helambu.

External pressures can force mountain communities to overexploit their resource base for survival. A low resilience of mountains arises due to steepness, low temperatures and thin, young soils. The time scale of ecosystem recovery may be hundreds of years.

	"The involvement of mountain peoples in Protected Area planning and management is especially imperative since they know how to live with mountains." ~ (Lawrence S. Hamilton, 2002).


The significance of culture for natural resource management is apparent in a diversity of cultures and subsistence strategies including multiple production zones, emerged as a response to the niche-specificity of mountains and the necessity to skilfully maximise production whilst at the same time minimising risk and conserving resources. Mountain cultures and environment are complementary, and in various stages of evolution (Shukadeb et al. 2001).

Based on principles of reciprocity, a kind of give and take with an animated nature parallels the reciprocal relations within the social sphere. Thus cultural dissolution into dominant societies will have consequences for the indigenous people's ability to manage a fragile environment. Agents of cultural dissolution include resource-extraction, market expansion, tourism, immigration and emigration and population growth.

However, mountain communities are among the world's poorest and most marginalised. Traditional economies suffer from unfavourable terms of trade (Mountain Institute, 2002). Traditional cultures of indigenous groups may be equally, or even more threatened than biological diversity (Byers, 1995).


Sustainable Tourism and Development
===================================
Decisions by many less Less developed Countries (LDC's) to place a high priority on tourism includes the willingness of the World Bank and others to fund projects. Tourism is viewed as an agent of regional development. Tourism to LDC destinations is steadily increasing (WTO 1995).

Most if not all forms of tourism could be, with application, 'sustainable tourism', e.g. Disney World. Sustainable tourism facilitates sustainable tourism development (Butler, 1980), but not necessarily rural communities. Alternative tourism (AT) represents a shift in focus from the well-being of the tourist industry to the well-being of the host community. AT is characterised as small scale and low impacts. Ecotourism, a subset of AT, has the natural environment as main motive for travel (Cater, 1994).

Trends exist towards synthesis of socio-cultural AT and environmental AT, as apparent in the community-based approach of Murphy (1985) to tourism planning. This approach offers potential for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity (Moutain-Forum 1998), as a means for retaining limited-use zones, with sustainable harvests. Ecotourism as &#8220;a practical and effective means of obtaining social and economic improvement for all countries... &#8221; (Ceballos-Lascurain, 1991), offers more.

There is little extensive research on possible negative impacts (Singh, 1999). Where site-specific indicators exist, there is a difficulty in determining the extent to which tourism, as opposed to other forces, is culpable for any impact.


Case Study, Annapurna
=====================

*Annapurna Conservation Area Project (ACPAP):*


Planned Tourism
---------------
Tourism came to Annapurna in the mid-1970's. King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC) initiated the ACPAP to minimise the negative impact from unplanned tourism and promote conservation and socio-economic development of the region. Change in status to a multiple use area in 1986 in place of the restrictive National Park recognised the need to accommodate traditional life styles. Environmental protection was to be combined with sustainable community development, in consultation with communities (Gurung, 1992).

KMTNC studied and systematised a tradition of zones, including intensive-use, limited-use, and wilderness areas. A zone with traditions and cultures largely unchanged excluded tourism. A high impact-zone was marked for recovery-management where local communities had responded to emergent tourism with uncontrolled developments and deteriorating standards of accommodation.

Reducing friction and negative impacts
--------------------------------------
Lodges within ACPAP were moved to seven central sites, currently restricted to twenty-six lodges housing a maximum of fifteen guests each per night. To compensate for a decreased number of lodges, at least two households must share the ownership of each lodge. Social friction brought on by unhealthy competition among lodge owners was curtailed. Most lodges remained in the Sherpa hands, though a minority.

Capacity-building measures brought improvements in waste disposal, reduced firewood consumption, improved food preparation,economic diversification, revenue retention. Traditional forest management committees, and lodge committees were made responsible for enforcing regulations, with success.

Financial sustainability to be achieved through user fees. Revenue sharing is used for community development and conservation.
Demand for wood-fuel was having a severe impact upon forests close to trails and lodges. Key users of fuel wood were lodge-owners. All lodges today use kerosene and not wood for energy. Micro-hydro electricity was not available in the short time required.

Immigration
-----------
In ACPAP tacit agreements exist which to prevent outsiders to buy property, which prevents a mushrooming of second homes as has occurred in rural Alpine areas, and which presents another threat to physical and social environments: most of the new settlers who migrate to them differ from the indigenous people in both behaviour and economic activity (Singh 1999)


Economic Initiatives
====================
Outside donors met 50% of initial ACPAP costs. Local contributions in money or in kind of a minimum 50% of the costs of a project promoted serious initial intent and ensure long term community commitment. In Syabru Besi, Nepal, tourism activities declined sharply when financial support was withdrawn (Banskota, 1998b). Grants can jump-start ecotourism initiatives. With free money, there is often a tendency to rush into tourism projects without a sound business plan.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided loans to Nepal's KMTNC to develop micro-hydro electricity, campsites, and community lodges in the GKSEDP. Revenue-generating activities can repay loans. Loans were also provided to fund the development of trails, community drinking water, and waste management. Such activities enhance the experience for tourists but provide no direct benefits to the community, making these these loans difficult to manage. Grants may have been more appropriate for enhancing such public goods (Chandra Gurung (1998b).

Permit fees should be able to recover direct costs and indirect cost such as trail maintenance, preservation of religious and sacred sites, and even support for local schools where government support is inadequate.

ADB is convinced that increasing the economic benefits from (or attributable to) protected areas may be the optimum strategy to avoid jeopardising the viability of natural resource systems (McNeely, 1994). However, the strategy will only succeed where ecotourism does not appropriate the environment and human societies, subtly redefined as universal property, through the imposition of elitist management plans.

Combinations of grants, and NGO external assistance appear to be useful, if not essential to community initiatives. A royal trust proved effective in implementation of the ACAP because of its connections, autonomy from government, a uniquely Nepalese NGO (Wells & Brandon, 1992).


Case Study, Mustang
===================
*Upper Mustang Conservation and Development Project (UMCDP):*

Upper Mustang was opened to tourism in March 1992, a government policy of incremental increase in order to offset pressure in established sites. Mustang's capital Lo-Manthang, is 10 days hard walking from the nearest road-head. There is no communication linkage. Situated in a rain-shadow, with short growing season and under snow for 4 months. 70% emigrate for trade during winter, leaving only young and old. Fuel-wood is scarce.

Trekkers were limited to 200 per year, compelled to join self-contained tenting groups and pay a fee of US$ 1000 per ten day trek. Fuel-wood was limited with a kerosene-only policy and tourists were required to carry waste out of Mustang.

In August 1992 the KMTNC was called in to identify needs and priorities. Time was spent establishing rapport with local people, and on environmental awareness activities, and UMCDP was established to develop infrastructure, build capacity and regulate tourism.

Pressure from the private sector: Unplanned Tourism
Within two months of opening to tourism, lobbying by the tourist industry brought an initial US$1000 per ten day Mustang trek down to $700 ; expansion of a 200 persons per year limit to 400, and six months later to 1,000 tourists per year, in spite of perceived carrying capacities. Yet it was in response to such criticism that the ACAP was extended into Upper Mustang.

The Nepal government withheld money; only 41% instead of 60% promised given in 1992; this declined to 4.5% by 1997. Expectations of local people raised beyond realistic levels. Local people initially received no income (Shackley, 1996). Insistence upon self-contained tent treks employing non-local Sherpa and others incited local resentment, as revenues were negligible. Local people went in for quick money rather than long term returns.

Rules were set for tourists concerning fuel and waste, but not for porters and guides. With 4 staff per tourist on average, tourism has contributed to resource degradation and litter problems.

The number of horses kept has increased for hire to tourists, one of the few ways locals can profit from tourists. Numbers of yaks has declined. Horses are advised as pack animals, since they are (wrongly) advised to consume less of the rare food grains than porters.

Keeping horses introduces competition between men and horses for grain, where only 55% of local food grains are met by local production. The price of grain has risen by three times in four years, since the opening of Mustang to tourism. Horse cannot graze at higher pastures; under-utilisation of high pastures and rangelands, coupled with collection of dung for fuel from rangelands, which are not suitable for horses, will contribute to overgrazing in the vicinity of villages (Blamont, 1996).

The KTMNC lobbied hard not to open Mustang for three years. The rapid pace at which tourism was brought in without infrastructure development or proactive community planning and training led to problems. Creation of economic disparity has brought about social disharmony. Clearly the private sector lacked long-term vision. Government policies changed often.

An officer was required to accompany each trek to ensure no smuggling of valuable artefacts out of Mustang, and that a proscribed route is followed. This failed to continue.

Five international donor agencies in the UMCDP region have created problems with duplication, contrary methods and competition for community support. KMTC then led meetings with the government and these NGOs to improve co-ordination.


Case Study, Bhutan
==================

Tourism as A Political Tool in Bhutan
-------------------------------------
A policy of 'low-volume, high-yield' tourism (Sharma 1998d) has allowed for significant control over environmental and social impacts in Bhutan. The tourists are required to spend a minimum fee per day, 10% and 35% allocated respectively, to foreign travel agents and as a government royalty.


Motivated by concerns over the Indian annexation of adjacent Sikkim, restrictive policies in Bhutan were ended in 1974, and tourism employed as a political tool to gain international recognition (Richter, 1989), and thereby tourism safeguards communities.


Case Study, Ghale Kharka Siklis
===============================

Ghale Kharka-Siklis Ecotourism Development Project (GKSEDP)
-----------------------------------------------------------
ACAP organised Village Development Committees in the GKSEDP  in advance. Committees responsible for managing natural resources, lodges, campsites, electricity, and a Mothers Group were duly established. The strength of each committee lies in a relatively broad community representation. The GKSEDP fostered community-owned lodges and campsites.

A Langtang-Helambu exchange visit spurred the creation of a women's dance program for tourists, and a revolving loan program. The funds they generated are used to restore a local monastery. Participatory Rural Appraisal techniques and appreciative inquiry helped community members gain a better understanding of women's roles. Crafts are sold to tourists, but local markets are not well developed for such micro-enterprise.


Lessons From Case Studies
=========================
UMCDP Mustang, demonstrates how carrying capacities are difficult to gauge, frequently apparent only after they have been exceeded. Attempts to control visitation were thwarted because of lucrative revenues. Although a UMCDP work plan was drawn up, and infrastructure has been improved and established, the KMNTC had no well defined role, and was not authorised to enforce rules within the protected area. Development projects and licences were issued by the government without the knowledge of KMNTC. Overall responsibility for organisation and co-ordination of development activities remained in question, and for which the project suffered.

ACPAP is a fair example of deliberately planned AT designed to negate a boom and stagnation cycle, described by Butler (1980). However, increased tourist use of mountains also inevitably means increased biophysical and cultural impacts (Mountain Forum 1995). Zoning and regulation of a tourist region are essential for protecting the fragile environments and local culture ecology.

GKSEP demonstrates how community-owned enterprises may safeguard social cohesiveness. Decentralised co-ordination and control, as opposed to consensus and independent action, were key to success in terms of equity and social cohesion. This appears to negate formation of a local elite. Community benefits were achieved through trusts. Outcomes in terms of status of the cultural relationship to the productive land base is yet to be determined.

ACPAP, UMCDP and GKSEP together demonstrate how without local participation in the design of development activities, benefits are less likely to provide widespread community benefits.


Conclusion, Culture, Tourism and Natural Resources
==================================================
The case studies under examination indicate that a favourable national or regionally co-ordinated policy environment is central to the success of community-based mountain tourism. They indicate the potential of a decentralised approach. An understanding of local ecosystem processes, the organisational mechanisms through which communities interact with their physical environments, social dynamics at both the household and community levels, and local priorities are crucial to external aid.

Planned tourism cannot itself safeguard a mountain rural community, except perhaps temporarily, as in the case of Bhutan. Tourism is potentially ruinous to cultural integrity and resource.

Equitable social improvements can be achieved through improved local infrastructure, by revenue sharing. Tourism can bring limited financial benefits and intercultural exchange if negative impacts can be avoided. To do so impacts must be considered in advance planning at a local level, in a principled way with deep appreciation of local culture.

Principles that focus on traditional stewardship roles of mountain communities, as opposed to external and distant control, appear particularly promising. Such thinking has been greatly assisted by Chapter 13 of the 1992 Earth Summit's Agenda 21, entitled &#8220;Managing Fragile Ecosystems: Sustainable Mountain Development,&#8221;

Any initiative to safeguard communities, must reverse existing processes of marginalisation of mountain cultures, and not exacerbate them. Appropriate technologies and capacity-building are essential.


Discussion, Cultural Integrity
==============================
There are signs the integrity of a culture in degeneration, and the examples which follow point to market forces, where, in addition to artefacts and practices, intrinsic values at at stake.

* Selling authentic and possibly sacred artefacts through desperation equals loss of culture, or because earning revenue is a higher priority equals devaluation of culture. Competition with cheap imitators lowers the value of original crafts where poor marketing skills exist.

* Culture is something that the people believe in implicitly; turning it into a pay performance, and it can no longer be believed in, in the way it was before. In effect this robs people of the very meanings by which they organise their lives (Greenwood, 1989).

* Where a small women's co-operative generates revenue that exceeds the combined income of all men in the village, for example, the situation is more likely to generate resentment than appreciation.

* Marginalisation occurs in terms of core-periphery relationships (highland - lowlands), and equity. A collaborative local elite reinforces the power of the local elite at the cost of wider community disempowerment (Hall, 1995). Of 56 larger trekking and travel agencies in Katmandu, 26 were controlled by Sherpas despite very small numbers (Robinson, 1994).

* Micro-enterprises can play a part in deculturisation through commodification; nature -based opportunities exist which may not have that effect. Alton Byers (1998), related the case of a Rai shikari (hunter) in Nepal who earned income from tourists as a naturalist after his hunting grounds were declared a national park. His many skills included the ability to call in several species of birds using grass blades, hollow reeds or whistles and identify the &#8220;thoughts&#8221; of a leopard by its pug marks.


Markets and the Resource Base
=============================

Markets and Relationship to the Resource Base
---------------------------------------------
Improved access to external markets is viewed by development experts in a positive light because of the access to jobs and cash incomes, but it means that communities no longer need to be self-sufficient. Shortfalls in subsistence production no longer need be disastrous as foodstuffs can now be purchased in local markets. Increasing dependence upon markets for agricultural inputs and food items erodes's traditional roles and knowledge, which in turn affects a households' ability to adjust to emergencies.

Women are now increasingly viewed simply in terms of their roles as providers of labour as opposed to managers of the land. Men increasingly migrate to seek employment in the foothills and plains to bridge the growing gap between subsistence production and consumption.


Relationship to the subsistence base
------------------------------------
An altered relationship to the subsistence base is transforming patterns of natural resource use and management. With changes in dietary habits erosion of traditional genetic diversity has occurred. Hybrid wheat seeds produce shorter and thicker stalks which are not favoured as animal feed. As a consequence, in many areas women must rely heavily on forest leaves and grasses.

Once freely available grasses or wood have now been converted into commodities, making people dependent on access to cash for essential inputs. Women routinely travel considerable distances in order to exploit non-local natural resources, which generates tensions leading to a more proprietary attitude toward forest resources, a trend which emphasises competition between user groups rather than stressing similar interests and concerns.

Renegotiation of work schedules erodes traditional household labour exchanges. Much work is conducted in isolation, which has affected the women's ability to perform traditional tasks. Lack of labour is leading to neglect of fields, terraces and irrigation channels and, collection of dung for use on agricultural fields. The collected dung normally ensures a minimum level of fertilisation for thin mountain soils, a crucial contribution to the sustainable use of resources in the mountains (Denholm, 1990).


Tourist Enclaves
----------------
It is feasible to consider that tourist enclaves may protect traditional life from intrusion. Most mountain tourism is concentrated within a limited space inside a few major trekking regions. Tourist may be influenced by the lifestyle of the hosts, but there is a tendency of tourists to adhere to their own cultural norms. Contact of small numbers of visitors may be insidious over time, and in a more invasive manner, as the alternative tourist seeks out a more &#8220;authentic&#8221; form of interaction with that community (MacCammall, 1976).

Stevens (1993) reports that although Sherpas have become more westernised, they have an enhanced ethnic pride because of valuation of their services and culture by tourists. Pride does guarantee safety for a cultural ecology. Cultural identities are intimately bound up with cultural ecologies which tend to be holistic (Croes, 2002).


Leakage
-------
Only 20 cents for 3 dollars spent daily by trekkers was obtained by local villages in Annapurna (Gurung, 1992), due largely to the tendency of lodges to import foodstuffs and goods. Food imports designated for tourist consumption, but available to locals, provide a disincentive for local production. However, growth of tourism usually coincides with acquisition of mass media access, believed to be more persuasive than exposure to tourists, in encouraging a taste for imported products (Weaver, 1988).

Entry-fees are a useful way to reduce leakage. An alternative of land use fees is provided by the Masai in Kenya, who are not interested in business, which in any case would damage their culture, were they to become vendors.


Degeneration and Safeguards
===========================

Identifying forces of degeneration
----------------------------------

Tourism is not the sole cause of degeneration of mountain livelihoods. The extent of the impact and degree of tourisms' culpability in deforestation is contentious; deforestation occurred long before the introduction of tourism (Stevens, 1993). A forest nationalisation decree accelerated deforestation 1957, undermining constraints imposed by communal and sacred stands, a measure which ironically was taken in order to prevent the continued conversion of forest into farmland (IUCN, 1991).

Himalayan mountain cultures were once engaged in caravan trade through a continent-wide network. Introduction of Indian salt has severely reduced the once lucrative trans-Himalayan trade of Tibetan salt for Himalayan grains.

Signing in 1983 of a pact between Nepal and China forbade transhumance patterns taking full effect in 1989 Affected winter pasture for yaks, which also accounts for their decrease. Unless Lobas can produce enough locally or through trade to support themselves, the few tourists entering Lo will behold a desert and ruins. (Blamont 1996). A Nepali government should engage in negotiations with China regarding mutual access to pastureland. Tourism cannot suffice as the main source of local income. Technological innovations in on-farm processing, and labour-reducing applications has potential to improve the welfare of highland communities.

Safeguards
----------
Can tourism safeguard rural communities, with appropriate and effective planning and management? The case of Bhutan shows it can, as a political tool. However, this example also points to tourism's vulnerability to political instability, a reason why tourism cannot be relied on to safeguard communities. The Nepali government withheld funds, which jeopardises a project relying on fees, and serves to exacerbate marginalisation in terms of core-periphery relationships. It is unsurprising therefore, that concerns are raised about ACAP's future in the face of political problems (Shackley, 1996). Zurich (1992) provides a further warning: Remote areas are places where indigenous people traditionally reside; expanded tourism occurs precisely where the traditional interests of local people intersect with resource frontiers for national development.

UMCDP further demonstrates how tourism may accelerate the decline of marginal activities, bringing negative impacts which outweigh financial returns to conservation and community development. A local strategic plan is required to establish and manage tourism in such a manner that maximises benefits to the community and equitably distributes those benefits is properly developed and executed. Local tourism strategic plans should aim only for the degree and type of change desired by the local community. Prior Informed Consent enables local people to enter into partnerships whilst being fully informed of the intentions and purposes of any programs, the possible benefits and risks, the documentation and ownership of cultural information, and legal means to opt out. (Croes, 2002). Who decides and who benefits and loses from decisions, should be explicit issues of discussion and debate among the people whose culture is at issue.

It should be noted, however, that local people have their own ways of categorising, valuing, and exploiting their natural surroundings. This means that local people and scientifically trained natural resource managers from outside do not know how to "talk" with each other - even when they speak the same national language. The creation of mutual, context-specific vocabularies would therefore seem necessary. (Croes, 2002). Should communities become dependent on outside experts who impose an AT model and re-educate the local people, the entire issue of local decision making control is called into question (Weaver, D. 1998). Conservation is likely to be most effective when it reinforces traditional rights and conservation practices (IUCN, 1980).
