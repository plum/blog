Designation
==============
* Grade I SSSI, Candidate SAC.

Size:

* Armeria vegetation: 	 4.ha (largely on quarry and minespoil)
* Non Maritime Cliff:		  0.5 ha
* Disused Quarry and Minespoil: 4.2ha
* Rock outcrops and Inland cliffs: 3.2ha


Description
==============
 Two stone quarries were formerly worked: Rock Studio quarry, and Pigeon's Cave, stone from which is said to have been used to construct the Conwy Cob, Telford's Suspension Bridge at Conwy (1826) and later Stephenson's Tubular Bridge at Conwy (1848).

Ground disturbed by mining and quarrying activities, or wartime construction works provide warm and sheltered micro-climates which hold communities of of insects. They are generally poorly vegetated with much bare ground, Armeria maritima, and a variety of flowering plants, including the nationally scarce Marrubium vulgare.

Reptiles such as common lizard and adder may bask in the warmth. Horseshoe bats (UKBAP/LSAP) may roost in cave-like quarries, where feeding opportunities are often good, due to the abundance of insects.

Great Orme was once at the bottom of the sea, and the area is abundant in fossil remains. The quarries provide an opportunity for geological study and are a feature of archaeological interest.

Rock outcrops and inland cliffs also hold Paleontological and nature conservation interest with comparable vegetation.


Current condition and status of feature
=======================================

Disused Quarries and Mine spoil

* Total Area: 4.2 ha. 


Current Status: 

* Favourable Maintained, as of December 2001. This assertion is based upon the 2000/2001 survey. All within LAC .


Attributes selected as performance indicators
=============================================
The Disturbed ground, Non Maritime Cliff, Rock outcrops and Inland cliffs will be considered to be in favourable condition provided the following attributes are within LACs:


Extent
-----------------
All Disturbed ground, Non Maritime Cliff, Rock outcrops and Inland cliffs:

* Extent is not likely to change as a result of factors under human control; monitoring extent is not appropriate for this feature.
* Component plant communities are largely governed by edaphic and climatic conditions. These are relatively static factors and so no area limits need be set.


Quality
-----------------
All sites

* Associated plants as indicators of change
* Fossils
* Bare ground
* Cover of Scrub species
* Safety recommendations are complete


Attributes and Operational Limits
=================================

Objective statement
---------------------
To maintain the Disturbed ground, Non Maritime Cliff, Rock outcrops and Inland cliffs with its species and fossils in favourable condition, WHERE:


Quality
--------------------

Associated plants as indicators of change:

* Lower Limits: The four of the five species exist at 50% of year 2000 cover.
* Monitor frequency of:

    * *Armeria maritima, Hornungia petraea, Sedum album, Erodium maritimum, Marrubium vulgare*.         

Fossils:

* signs non removal = zero
* Lower limit: No more signs than year 2000.
* Monitor: signs of fossil removal
                                           
Bare ground:

* % of bare ground over extent of feature = 50%
* Lower limit= 60%
* Monitor: % cover bare ground    

Cover of Scrub species: 

* % cover = 10%
* Lower limit = 20%
* Monitor: % cover scrub species.   

Safety recommendations are complete: 

* Lower Limits: none set.
* Monitor: Implementation of safety recommendations.    


Management Rationale and Projects
=================================


Visitor use
-----------------
Trampling by visitors causes significant wear, prevents growth of plants, and disturbs breeding birds. Heavy usage may cause a site to become unstable, and therefore, unsafe. Substantial visitor access is not desirable

Monitor/Surveillance Projects:

* Limit use, to use with permission only.
* Monitor erosion.

Scrub encroachment and Invasive exotics
----------------------------------------
Scrub encroachment and invasion by exotics may replace unique assemblages of quarry species, if complete. Bare ground must be maintained, if necessary, and scrub controlled. There is the target to increase Juniper: See Feature,  *Dense/Scattered Scrub*.

Monitor/Surveillance Projects:

* Monitor scrub encroachment.
* Cut scrub gradually to limit growth.
* Monitor and control Invasive exotics.
* Preserve Juniper.


Natural deterioration
-------------------------
A quarry face may be gradually eroded by weathering and slippage. The face of one mine is considered unstable, with a projected high cost of Â£10-20,000 to excavate, every five years, in order to make it safe for visitors. Limiting activity to Geological associations is a useful consideration. Re-excavation, may be carried out through a process of gradual and sound working practice by members.

Monitor/Surveillance Projects:

* Refer those interested to clubs, through the Geological Association.


Fossil collecting
-------------------------
Collection of the fossil is illegal according to local bylaws. Damage occurs to deposits by irresponsible specimen collecting. Irresponsible collecting may destroy an entire site.

Monitor/Surveillance Projects:

* Monitor for signs of illegal collecting, regularly on rounds.
* Enforce prohibition


Safety and access
-------------------------
Safety on quarries normally requires adequate footwear, and a helmet. Access to quarry edges from above presents danger of falls.Fencing off a whole quarry is expensive to construct and maintain, and possibly not in keeping with the landscape.

A stone wall restricting access from below may be visually acceptable and effective in restricting access; Advice will be sought. Mine dumps are safer, and could be be visited, with permission.

Non Maritime Cliff, Rock outcrops and Inland cliffs present danger to walkers, and visitors will be requested to stay on the paths.

Monitor/Surveillance Projects:

* Close off access to the quarries from below, with temporary fences.
* Erect warning signs from above and below.
* Monitor use.
* Consider stone wall restricting access from below and seek funding.
* Refer to expert safety inspectors of quarries fro recommendations.
* Issue obvious warning to all visitors to stay on paths, away from Disturbed ground, Non Maritime Cliff, Rock outcrops and Inland cliffs.


Paleontological interest
-------------------------
Exposure sites reveal new rock surfaces to be analysed. Interests of geological societies, and researchers will be accommodated, subject to considerations of safety, and with permission (see safety and access).


Management Options
==================
Continuously:

* A3:   Active management
* E2:   Restricted access.
