Management Rationale and Projects
=================================


Continuity of growth
--------------------
At present, intervention is limited to footpath clearing and some blackthorn scrub clearance.

Active management is needed to revive continuous practices where neglected, in order to ensure plant communities may persist through natural regeneration and promote the full range of woodland biodiversity.

Woodland Birds and mammals require the maintenance of a mixture of age classes. Most species of woodland butterfly depend upon open spaces, including rides, glades and continuity of young growth.  Epiphytes, flora and fungi require a continuity of mature trees. Saproxylic invertebrates depend upon dead, dying or living wood. (ash beech, oak, and elm particularly)

Fragmented woodlands, lacking natural populations of large predators and grazers, require human management to mimic natural processes (i.e semi-natural). Three options will be employed to assist natural processes in continuity of young through to old growth, and open spaces: Coppicing, Managed grazing and Thinning (see below for proscriptions).


Vegetation Maps and Compartmental management
--------------------------------------------
Compartmental management allows for heterogeneous management and maintenance of all phases of local populations; for example, epiphyte lichens could become excessively shaded with relaxation of grazing.

In order to monitor rate and change in performance indicators against baselines it is essential to relate management actions to tree or compartment. Vegetation maps in terms of stand types and structure (including fallen trees), and compartment, will be prepared. Glades, rides, paths, watercourses, rock faces/outcrops and artefacts will be recorded. Actions, using a simple map for each action, will be recorded.

Origins, and past management of the sites may be discovered by reference to earliest OS, and further back in time with bank and ditch maps and pollen analysis records of the woodland seed bank. This project may be linked to schools' projects.

Monitoring and projects:

* Survey structural and species vegetation changes.
* Monitor vegetation with photographs from fixed points.
* Draw up compartmental maps with planned rotations.


Coppicing Hazel
---------------
Historically, coppicing for smelting of ore from local mines is a possibility. Neglect of coppice leads to the loss of early successional species. Open woodland is required by some birds, such as Pied Flycatchers (*Ficedula hypoleuca*). Rotated management maintains continuity in succession. We will cut Hazel on a 15 year rotation.

Operational limits:

* Target:	Coppice hazel in rotation
* Upper limit: 	10% of hazel cut per year
* lower limit:	5% of hazel cut per year

Monitor/Surveillance:

* Survey location of hazel.
* Coppice and retain single stem where possible, protecting the stool with brashings.
* Layer or replant from seed of local provenance, where neglected stools are lost.


Managed Grazing
--------------------
Light grazing by both sheep and goats occurs in both woods, but there is little natural regeneration. Some initial light grazing benefits natural tree regeneration; there will be no more than 1 sheep per acre per year.

Stock will be removed from about 50% of the area within the next 5 years, for a period of at least 5 years, stock-grazing limited to periods of twice annually over five years. This will reduce trampling in nesting and early growth seasons, and promote a varied understorey structure. A fenced compartment for the purpose will be constructed. Effects of stocking rates are poorly understood, and changes in practice will be carefully monitored.

In order to control grazing all boundary and other fences must be maintained in a stock proof condition. Post and rail stock fencing in cleaved local oak is strong and cost effective, and will allow free movement of wild animals.

 Concern that goats strip the bark of saplings and so prevent natural regeneration will be examined, and populations controlled accordingly.

Operational limits:

* Target 1:	periodical grazing= Upper limit.
* Upper limits:	2 sheep grazing periods per year in grazed zone.
* Lower limit:	1 sheep grazing periods per year in grazed zone.
* Target 2 :	Density= upper limit
* Upper limit: 	1 sheep per acre per year.
* lower limit:	1 sheep per acre per year (or equivalent).

Monitor/Surveillance, Projects:

* Monitor and control presence of wild grazers, including goats.
* Inspect and repair all fences.
* Establish grazed and un-grazed zones with provision of extra fencing.


Thinning in blocks - Gap creation
---------------------------------
Non-native species of conifer and sycamore are likely to interfere with natural-regeneration of native woodland. Their gradual removal by felling offers an opportunity to aid gap creation, and restore the natural -regenerative capacity of the woodland by allowing light to reach light-demanding seedlings. Spread of Sycamore (*Acer psuedoplatanus*) will be resisted, as it may disrupt semi-natural communities of trees. However, old sycamore is host to about 40 species of insect associated with elm, thus large old trees may be retained.

Operational limits:

* Target 1: No non-native conifers to remain in ten years.
* Upper limit:  none
* Lower limit:  none
* Target 2: Gradual reduction in density of young sycamore to 1/ha. over ten years.
* Upper limit:  Remove four sycamore trees per year.
* Lower limit:  Non set.

Monitor/Surveillance Projects:

* Monitor growth of Sycamore seedlings and cut stems.
* Restore conifer to broadleaf, or fell to create gap (but not Scots pine), gradually.
* Remove sycamore, gradually, but retaining larger, old trees.
* Uproot sycamore seedlings.
* Encourage new seedling growth

In order to ensure continuity of young growth succeeding to mature trees, native seedlings may be nursed from local seed, within the wood if desired. Self-seeded young trees may be given the opportunity to flourish by protecting them from grazing.

Monitor/Surveillance Projects:

* Plant seeds in gaps.
* Monitor and protect growth of all seedlings, including self-seeders.


Deadwood piles
--------------------
Deadwood provides habitat to fauna, and decaying wood in the cycle of nutrients, essential in the ecological flows of woodland. In addition to fallen trees, any cut material will be stacked in a pile and not burnt, except for material removed as a local resource.

Monitor/Surveillance Projects:

* Monitor fallen trees and decaying wood on ground.
* Construct deadwood piles with cuttings from trees.
* Construct deadwood fences, which could also compartmentalise grazing.


Old trees
--------------------
The alkaline bark old ash (and elm where it still survives) supports important lichen flora, particularly the Lobarion community, and dying trees provide habitat for rare beetles, flies and other invertebrates. Pollarding tends to prolong the life of a tree, if young or middle-aged, and not heavily shaded.

Pollarding protects trees from grazing animals. Trees will be selected for pollarding. Ancient trees will be perpetuated by sympathetic management.

Monitor/Surveillance Projects:

* Monitor age of trees.
* Liaise with local Tree Officer, concerning ancient trees and perpetuation/protection.
* Monitor condition of old trees, leaf and stem, for disease.
* Select trees for pollarding to extend life.
* Monitor effects of grazing upon old trees.
* Monitor compaction of ground at foot of old trees.


Scrub
--------------------
*UK priority BAP/ LBAP designation*

Old scrub at edges will be controlled by grazing in preference to cutting because it perpetuates scrub which otherwise turns to coppice. We will promote hawthorn scrub which is in early and middle stages of growth, for a full range of insects and birds. Blackthorn spreading by suckering will be controlled at existing limits, in order to permit semi-natural growth of Ash woodland.
Operational limits:

* Target: No decrease in extent of scrub.
* Limits: refer to grass and heath and woodland features for limits to expansion

Monitor/Surveillance Projects:

* Monitor condition and growth and extent of scrub within woodland.
* Regenerate old leggy scrub by cutting, or by grazing by ponies.
* Perpetuate old scrub at edges with cattle or pony grazing.
* Control spread of Blackthorn by cutting.


Invasive non-native shrubs
----------------------------------------
 Cotoneaster spp. will be uprooted. The presence of other ornamentals and their spread, particularly near to the edges of woodland, will be resisted.

Monitor/Surveillance Projects:

* Refer to performance indicators, plus:
* Obtain best available advice, and plan removal of identified alien species, with care to determine whether the plant is rhizomatic or not.

Banks and ditches
--------------------
Banks and ditches are to be protected from scrub encroachment.

Operational limits: none set.

Monitor/Surveillance Projects:

* Monitor physical condition, and signs of change
* Scrub control.
* Ditch clearance.


Rides and glades
--------------------
These support light-demanding species, perhaps absent elsewhere in the wood, including grassland plants, grassland and scrub invertebrates, flowering plants and feeding insects.

Rides and glades may link openings within stands, and so allow re-population of new gaps.

The majority of species depend upon warm, sunny conditions, and shading will be kept to a minimum with a cutting/grazing regime incorporating three rotational zones, from inner to outer edge. Rides will be maintained at minimum width: Rides not in an east-west orientation, enjoying less sun, need to be wider. Any widening will be carried out over several years, to minimise negative impact to populations.

New glades may be created in conjunction with rides by removing corners at intersections, or as scallops alongside rides. Rides may serve as paths. New rides, where needed, may be constructed from existing paths.

Operational limits:

* Target 1: 	Ride width.

  * Upper limit:	2 times height of adjacent trees.
  * Lower limit:	1.4 times height of adjacent trees.

* Target 2:	Rotational cutting of glade.

  * Upper limit:	Outer edge zone: cut every 8 years.
  
    * Mid-zone: cut piecemeal every 2 years
    * Inner zone: cut twice a year.

  * Lower limit:	Outer edge zone: cut every 20 years.
  
    * Mid-zone: cut piecemeal every 4 years
    * Inner zone: cut once a year.

Projects:

* Identify and map rides and glades
* Identify any need for new rides or glades.
* Plan cutting in rotation, according to minimum of four compartments


Species Surveys
--------------------
Surveys of the main groups of taxa will be continued, encouraging the participation of a local college of further education, and relevant local or branch societies.

Surveys:

* Groundcover species lists: The last vegetation survey of Haulfre Wood was carried out in March 1982 .
* Epiphytic flora and fungi, species
* Saproxylic invertebrate, species
* Butterfly, species
* Woodland bird, species
* Woodland mammal, species


Visitor and community access
----------------------------
Visitors can cause excessive trampling and disturbance. Visitors will be requested to stick to footpaths/rides. Local people use the woods frequently.

The long-term success in planned management probably depends upon a form of Community Woodland Management. Harm from undesired felling and removal of trees for firewood would be effectively curtailed. Thinnings could be useful to local gardeners and craftsmen, who may assist with cutting, after appropriate training. Protective actions, monitoring and regeneration may be most effectively implemented. Extra sources of funding may available, and will be requested.

Operational Limits: Non set.

Monitoring Projects:

* Identify short cuts through woodland.
* Monitor areas of trampling
* Monitor illegal wood cutting or removal
* Notify local communities of availability of wood resource, with permission and guidance.
* Liaise with Landowners and local community concerning Community Woodland Management.
* Build deadwood piles at shortcuts from paths.
* Construct deadwood fence alongside paths.
* Plant hawthorn alongside paths, at strategic places.


Management Options
==================
* A3: Active management to maintain and regenerate semi-natural woodland.
* E4: Open access. Request walkers stay on paths.
