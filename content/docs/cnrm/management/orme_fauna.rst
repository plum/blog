Management Rationale and Projects
=================================


Surveys
-------------
The fauna has not been surveyed comprehensively, therefore lists of the various groups should not be considered as complete. Information on different groups is added to on an almost annual basis, mainly as a result of independent survey work. Monitoring of butterfly populations, using a transect method developed by the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, has been undertaken since 1991.

Many of the invertebrates that occur in acid grassland are specialist species which do not occur in other types of grassland.

Fungi may include LBAP species, such as ballerina wax-cap. Surveys will be extended.

* Survey acid grassland invertebrates
* Survey Fungi


Manageable threats common to all
---------------------------------------
Habitat fragmentation. Loss of feeding grounds (grasslands, heath, bog, copse), loss of mixed farming, loss of mixed grazing, stock density (disturbance and grazing competition), loss of structural diversity, predators (cats, dogs, crows, magpies, stoats, weasels), habitat fragmentation. Changes from spring to autumn sowing of cereals. Egg collecting. Poisons.


Habitat
-------------
Some species, like the chough, require a range of habitats for feeding within its' range. In general, sound management of the habitat features has included structural diversity in its objectives and plans, to the benefit all species.
Management for invertebrate diversity in all habitats benefits birds in general, as well as bats. Reseeding of pastures with pure stands of rye grass will be opposed because it reduces the diversity of insect prey. Mixed grazing, a range of compartments, and mosaic grasslands increases invertebrate diversity.

Requirements of sward structure vary across species. Chough prefers short swards allow access to soil invertebrates. Reduced grazing by livestock and rabbits on the remaining grasslands is also associated with loss of curlew. Skylarks nest in treeless, short grassland less than 25 cm tall, yet intensive grazing of pasture can create a sward that is too short for nesting skylarks.
Volume of weed seeds available to linnets is held responsible for their recent steep decline. Changes from spring to autumn sowing of cereals, applies less to Gt Orme in recent history, though introduction of some cereal growing (mixed farming), and an area of 'set aside' will benefit feeding linnet, chough and skylark. Reintroduction of hay meadows may benefit sky lark.

A reduction in woodland edge, scrub habitat and, understorey is associated with loss of food supply, dry soils and, loss of suitable nesting opportunities, concerning the songthrush and bullfinch.

Badger favour wooded areas with grassland alongside. Food taken includes worms, frogs, birds' eggs, small mammals, carrion, roots and berries.

Monitoring & Projects:

* Seek to Introduce mixed grazing, and varied compartmentalised grazing rotations.
* Maintain grassland areas with required sward conditions for Skylark.
* Maintain grassland areas with required sward conditions for Chough.
* Maintain grassland areas with required sward conditions for Curlew.
* Monitor all ground nesting populations and map according to grazing regime.
* Monitor and map roost and feed sites of sensitive bird species occur.
* Seek opportunities to introduce small set aside areas of winter food for birds on farmland
* Seek opportunities to reintroduce two areas of hay meadow.
* Enforce prohibition of grassland 'improvements'
* Reduce grazing intensity i woodland.
* Encourage and manage marginal woodland vegetation.
* Monitoring wintering birds
* Encourage marginal and understorey vegetation favourable to small mammals.
* Ensure the provision of grass/woodland edge habitat.
* Monitor badger population


Disturbance
-------------
Disturbance of ground nesting and cliff nesting birds is associated with their decline. Disturbance by rock climbers, is now under control, and coincides with an increase in kittiwake. Badger hibernate and live in setts comprising a complex system of tunnels, from October to February. High stock density may cause disturbance to ground nesting birds and Hare.

* Monitor levels of disturbance, according to zone and season.
* Protect setts from disturbance.


Grazing Competition
--------------------------
High stock densities, or rabbits may compete with hare for grazing. Hares will no mix with rabbits.

Monitoring & Projects:

* Monitor hare populations and grazing intensity of stock and rabbits per zone.
* Monitor and control rabbit population.


Predation
-------------
An increase in predation rates on nests and chicks is associated with their decline, especially by foxes.

Monitoring & Projects:

* Monitor the effects of fox predation on nesting populations and hare and control if necessary.
* Monitor effects of crow predation birds and hare.
* Monitor hare population, counted in spring.


Poisons
-------------
Effects of chemical treatments can reduce invertebrate species and numbers, and will be vigorously opposed. Animal Injection is preferable to bolus treatment, because levels of the drug will decline, before deposition in dung.

Monitoring & Projects:

* Monitor and enforce the prohibition of chemical treatments.
* Liaise with farmers and vets concerning bolus treatments.

Collision
-------------
Utility lines and fences are associated with loss of some birds species, including curlew.

Monitoring & Projects:

* Monitor incidents of collision with overhead cables.

Cover
-------------
Brown hare require daytime cover in addition to feeding grounds (grasslands, heath, bog, copse).

Monitoring & Projects:

* Create cover of old heather and, marginal vegetation.


Roost Sites
-------------
Lesser horseshoe bat requires roost sites for hibernation, with stable winter temperatures (e.g.underground sites such as cave/mines); nursery roost sites and roost sites for males during spring and summer  (e.g.roof spaces, hollows in mature trees).

Monitoring & Projects:

* Provide nursery and male bat roost boxes.
* Protect old standing trees.
* Ensure underground entrances are not sealed off; liaise with Cave exploration society.


Habitat Fragmentation
-----------------------
Populations need to disperse or be colonised by populations on the mainland in order to thrive. Development of Llandudno town threatens remaining connectivity of by the causeway, with ensuing isolation of of mammals, reptiles and insect populations of the Gt Orme. Further development will be challenged on this issue. Existing developments will be surveyed for possible measures which may improve connectivity.

Connective strip to mainland through sand bar to be defined and managed with suitable cover.

Monitoring & Projects:

* Liaise with Planning departments for Llandudno.
* Campaign to raise awareness of the local issue of connectivity.


Management Options
==================

Continuously:

* A3:   Active management to create habitat mosaics and roost sites
* E4:   Open access. Request walkers stay on paths.
