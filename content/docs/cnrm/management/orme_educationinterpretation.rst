Evaluation
==============
 "*A Policy Statement for the Great Orme*"(1976), states an objective:

 "to Create opportunities for people to enjoy and appreciate the qualities of the Country Park without compromising the conservation objectives."

The Good Practice Guidelines for country parks (CCW, 1995) states,
  "country parks offer an excellent opportunity to provide and nurture environmental awareness for people of all ages..."

We shall continue to provide educational opportunities in Gt Orme Country Park because:

* One of the statutory purposes of the Country Park is realised by the continued service .
* Existing provision is consistent with CCW guidelines for country parks.


Description
===========
The site is used by school and university groups in the study of geographical, geological, biological, archaeological and historical topics. Country Park staff assist in the provision of environmental education with slide talks, guided walks, trails and events. Schools may take part in a full day of activities at the Great Orme. Links with the Copper Mines and Victorian Tramway have been established.

The Great Orme Country Park Visitor Centre was opened in 1983. It contains displays on the history, wildlife and management of the Great Orme. Information about the Country Park in the form of a variety of leaflets and booklets, produced by Conwy Countryside Service, is available in the gift shop (run by the North Wales Wildlife Trust).  A multi-purpose room at the visitor centre provides facilities for educational groups, and is also useful during periods of bad weather.

Research is continuously carried out on the history, archaeology, geology and natural history of the site individuals, agencies and educational establishments.

Interpretation panels, information boards and leaflets are available.

Management Rationale and Projects
=================================


Educational use/facilities
--------------------------
Facilities are adequate. An education pack for the Great Orme aimed at children aged 7-11 years is available, and this service and associated activities will be extended in order to meet wider needs. Incidents of damage by groups to sensitive areas are now rare, due to increasing environmental awareness in general, and due to specific information provided in the Visitor Centre; this will continued and.


Monitoring & Projects
---------------------

* Educational packs for older groups will be developed for 11-16 year olds in conjunction with curricula in Geography and Biology and Physics.
* Develop environmental learning activities in conjunction with local services for learning difficulties.
* Update leaflets on environmental awareness, including successes.
* Extend woodland history project to local schools.
* Involve schools in monitoring projects, such as woodland ground flora indicator plants.


Research use/facilities
-----------------------
Many specific projects have been completed and the results made available to the County Borough Council. Much is carried out without the involvement or knowledge of the wardening staff.

Monitoring & Projects:

* Ensure research projects are carried out with permission and, recorded.
* Request outcomes/productions of all research to made available.
* Prepare list of projects with which the Country Park would find assistance useful, in its management.

Leaflets
---------
A free promotional information leaflet with wide distribution, available of charge at local Tourist Information Centres and the Country Park Visitor Centre, is handed to all visitors arriving by car via the Marine Drive. Leaflets concerning grazing trials will be prepared for evaluation by the public, in order to extend the opportunities for informal education.

Monitoring & Projects:

* Prepare leaflet outlining grazing variation trials, with expectations concerning wildlife.


Interpretation panels
---------------------
An interpretation panel explains what can be seen on Pen y Dinas and its historical significance. Another, found on the Gunsite, explains the significance of the remains of remaining wartime buildings. A further interpretation panel is located at the Cromlech (Scheduled Ancient Monument). Many interpretation panels would spoil the wilderness qualities, and possibly be an unwelcome overload of information to many. The combination of a small number of panels will be reviewed for comprehensiveness as well as utility, such as avoidance of hotspots. A need for one interpretation panel to divert interest from the Pen y Dinas site has been identified (see archaeological features).

Monitoring & Projects:

* Design one archaeological interpretation board to serve several archaeological features, with trail route.
* Consider utility and balance of all interpretation panels together.


Focal points
------------
Surveys revealed intensive use of the quarries and limestone pavement areas by study groups. However, the quarries are dangerous for school groups. An exhibition of finds for the quarry will be prepared. The quarry will be closed off, and guided tours will be permissible, possibly using a fixed point telescope to examine the quarry surface.

Monitoring & Projects:

* Prepare exhibition of quarry finds.
* Plan guided tour of quarry in conjunction with safety measures (see Feature: Disturbed ground...)


Information boards
------------------
These are located at the entrances to the Country Park i.e. North Shore Tollgate on Marine Drive, entrance on Ty Gwyn Road, summit car park. At this time they are considered sufficient in number and detail.


Trails
------------------
The site has an established Nature Trail, which is way-marked and interpreted through a Nature Trail booklet. There are two Historical Trails around the site, self guided with the use of the Historical Trails booklet. Three Summit Trails are way-marked to encourage people to visit the Great Orme on foot; a leaflet gives directions. There is also a short way-marked route from the Ski Slope to the top of Pen y Dinas (Iron Age Hillfort). No further trails are considered necessary at this time beyond plans for an additional Summit Trail and a new leaflet.


Guided walks and Events
------------------------
There is a year round programme of guided walks and children's events. Country Park staff lead guided walks for organised groups mainly during the summer months, with interpretations of the Great Orme and its environmental features. Walks will be constantly improved with knowledge. Wider audiences than school groups are welcome, and disadvantaged groups will be contacted. New events will be selected and tried.

Monitoring & Projects:

* Update guided tours with feedback from participating staff, local experts, and public.
* Select and try new events with opportunities to learn about the Country Park management.
* Contact socially disadvantaged groups offering guided walks.


Slide Talks
------------------
Country Park staff give 10 - 15 slide talks groups during the Autumn and Winter months.

To extend this facility would be desirable, but staff levels will not permit this at this time. A part-time opportunities for environmental education staff will be sought, in order to increase the facility on a self-funded basis.

Monitoring & Projects:

* Prepare self-funded scheme for environmental talks and offer these to groups in land management and education.
