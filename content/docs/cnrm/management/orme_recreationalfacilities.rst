Designation
==============

* Country Park.


Evaluation
----------------

The primary purpose of country parks, as stated in the Countryside Act (1968), is
 	"to provide informal opportunities for countryside recreation".

We shall continue to promote recreational opportunities in Gt Orme Country Park because:

* One of the statutory purposes of the Country Park is realised by the continued service .
* Existing provision is consistent with CCW guidelines for country parks.


Description
===============
The headland is a renowned tourist attraction receiving in excess of 500,000 visitors each year. The Country Park offers extensive value in passive and active recreational activities. There also exist a number of commercial attractions. Pedestrian access around the site is unrestricted. There are a number of public rights of way and un-adopted footpaths. Restrictions to vehicles include a Pay and Display charge was introduced on a year round basis (reduced charges during the winter period).

Associated with recreational development, but lying outside the Country Park on land that is leased from the Council, are a number of enterprises. These included a golf course, Marine Drive, the gardens at Happy Valley. A dry ski slope, operated by Ski Llandudno since 1987, and attracts an additional large number of people for skiing and tobogganing. A Summit Complex includes gift shop, bar and amusement facilities.

Within the Country Park on land leased by the Council, lies the Great Orme Copper Mines Ltd., opened in 1991, which now attracts about 33,000 visitors per annum, and the Victorian Tramway about 119,000 visitors per season (Easter to the end of October).

Management Rationale and Projects
=================================

Vehicle access and congestion
------------------------------
The car park is set out with a low boundary wall, and a bank screens it from view, needing no further disguise. There are signs of vehicle congestion, with erosion which remove and scar old land surfaces. Past unrestricted vehicular access is now prohibited in the Bye-laws. Provision of services for increasing numbers of cars causes problems. Alternative means of access will be sought, and no increases in parking capacity will be allowed. Access roads are narrow, these will not be widened. Boulders placed alongside the access road has to discouraged overflow of vehicles. More may need to be placed. An overflow area onto amenity grassland is set aside for peak times. On hot sunny days, and bank holidays, car park management, including overspill arrangements and restrictions need management.

Where heathland has been fragmented by vehicle erosion, sheep have gained access and by grazing, slow down or prevent re-growth.

Monitoring & Projects:

- Monitor grasslands for signs of vehicle erosion
- Extend parking restrictions with boulders as necessary.
- Motorcycle scrambling is prohibited and will be guarded against.
- Casual parking of cars will be prevented.
- Restrictions will be enforced.
- Erect temporary fencing to permit regrowth of eroded areas where sheep need to be excluded.


Bank Holidays
------------------------------
Bank holidays are the most popular days of the year. It is desirable to provide an additional level of service on these days as the volume of visitors receiving corporate messages can be maximised.

Operational Limits:

- Lower limit: interpretive activities to take place on Bank Holidays Easter - August inclusive.


Pedestrian Access
------------------------------
Walking and associated activities such as sightseeing, bird watching and photography are detrimental to the landscape and wild life interests only in areas which are biologically sensitive and unable to withstand high levels of disturbance. Sensitive areas of limited extent will be restricted where practical. For the most part these are protected by a barriers of fenced farmland and steep cliffs.

Walking activities on the site may have adverse effects on ground-nesting birds, particularly in heathland where disturbance during the spring and summer could lead to nest desertion.

Visitors will be requested to stay on paths. Trampling along footpaths and the most heavily used parts of the site can lead to a reduction in the species-richness of the grassland. Trails of different lengths are needed by different users. A figure of eight gives walkers alternative route lengths. 0.9 m paths serve walkers, 1.2 m for two way use; 1.2 - 1.7 for wheel chairs. Routes potentially suitable for wheelchair users will be identified.


Monitoring & Projects:

- Grade zones use in terms of noise and activity levels, according to season.
- Monitor signs of excessive trampling refer to grassland, and adapt paths. (refer to Features: Calcicolous grasslands and, Heathland).
- Monitor width of paths at erosion points and widen as necessary, to permit two way use.
- Fix small, portrait-sized strategic signs, where necessary, concerning disturbance.
- Install finger-post way-marks.
- Identify & Protect severely eroded areas, in order to allow regeneration.
- Design Figure of eight path into existing walkways.
- Identify potential of walkways for wheelchair paths of 1.7 m width, and of < 1:4 slope.


Passive recreation
------------------------------
The most popular forms of recreation are passive in nature i.e. enjoyment of the scenery, picnicking, sunbathing etc.  The impact of passive recreation per se is not great. No measures need be taken.


Active pursuits
------------------------------
Activities include walking, rock climbing, sea angling, hang gliding, paragliding, model glider flying, jogging, mountain biking, orienteering and bird-watching, cave exploration. They threaten excessive disturbance to wildlife and, erosion. Active pursuits appear to have slight impact, but cause no accumulating deterioration.

Rock climbing in biologically sensitive areas is limited by agreement and is also controlled elsewhere in terms of public safety. Hang gliders/paragliders are restricted to one take-off point, and with no vehicular access.
A "code of conduct" exists for model-glider flyers and is enforced with the help of local club members. The Great Orme Exploration Society leases all underground workings from the Council and Mostyn Estates. Their entry is otherwise forbidden, and this ensures safety and codes of congenial use.

Monitoring & Projects:

- Monitor and enforce codes of conduct, and restrictions.


Vulnerability of features
------------------------------
Grasslands have been covered by erosion; archaeological remains - See the feature *Archaeological Sites.*	.


Litter bins
------------------------------

Monitoring & Projects:

- Monitor litter points, and identify usefulness and need for litterbins.

- Liaise with Summit complex, concerning litter.


Toilets
------------------------------
These exist at the Visitor Centre, and below Marine Drive on the Northern side. The Visitor Centre toilets may be inadequate on peak days.

Monitoring & Projects:

* Monitor toilet use at Visitor Centre on peak days.


Benches & picnic tables
------------------------------
Their provision is not considered necessary, as litter due to picnicking is minimal. A picnic area situated close to the Car park is a possibility for consideration.


Health and safety, visitor advice
----------------------------------
Access to certain caves is becoming increasingly dangerous as time passes. Warning signs/ improved access is being planned: Refer to Feature, *Archaeology*. Cliff approaches will be surveyed for adequacy of warning signs.

Monitoring & Projects:

* Limited numbers of warning signs to be placed near paths by cliffs.
* Access to quarries is dangerous and will be restricted.

Special needs.
Wheelchair access to the Visitor Centre is possible. No other restricted access by design has been identified.

Monitoring & Projects:

* Canvas public for views on disabled access to and on the site.


Vandalism
------------------------------
There is no substantial problem to the Park or facilities, which are designed to minimise opportunities for vandalism when unstaffed.


Illegal Pursuits Under the Country Park Bylaws
-----------------------------------------------
The site has been used for activities which are illegal under the bylaws: All detrimental to the landscape and/or wild life interests. The principal quarry of hunting and shooting have been rabbits. It seems birds and goats were also shot at. Collecting wild plants has presented a threat to plants. Uncontrolled use of metal detectors may lead to damage of archaeological and biological features. Following the introduction of a warden service, all these activities declined and continue to do so.

The removal of rock or turf causes damage to historical and biological features. It is difficult to control as the activity is carried out discretely. Fly tipping is conducted in dark evenings of during autumn and winter. Lighting fires has caused damage to heathland, especially on Halloween.

Monitoring & Projects:

* Monitor illegal activities,and enforce.


Dogs
-------
Dogs allowed to roam can worry sheep, and this will be cautioned against.

Monitoring & Projects:

* Request dogs to be kept on a lead, with sign at car park/footpath intersection and, in leaflet.
* Enforce requirement.
