Cotoneaster (*cambricus/C. integerrimus*)

Designation
=============
* listed as Endangered on the GB Red List and is protected under Schedule 8 of the WCA 1981.

Size:

* Population= 33 plants


Description
===========
Wild cotoneaster is restricted to this one locality in the UK, where it is considered to be endemic. The site is protected as an LNR and an SSSI.


Current condition and status of feature
=======================================
All performance indicators are within LACs.

However, natural recruitment to the site is poor, but one seedling plant was found in 1993 in an area where seeds were sown 10 years previously.


Current status: 

* Favourable maintained, based upon the 2000/2001 survey.


Attributes selected as performance indicators
=============================================
The species will be considered to be in favourable condition provided the following attributes are within LACs:


Extent
-----------------
* Numbers of plants.
* Number of occupied sites.


Quality
-------
* Age structure
* Fertility


Objective statement
-----------------------
Maintain the population Wild Cotoneaster in a favourable condition, WHERE:


Extent
-----------------
Numbers of plants remain at current status

* Target level:	33 plants
* Upper limit:	None set
* Lower limit: 	24 plants

Number of occupied sites remain at current levels, or increases.

* Target level: None set
* Upper limit: None set
* Lower Limit: current numbers; Remains Secret

Number of potentially suitable sites to not decrease.

* limits: none set.
* Monitor/survey:
* Numbers of plants
* Number of occupied sites.


Quality
-------
* Age structure remains of even distribution
* Limits: none set

Natural regeneration by seed is possible:

* Limits: none set
* Monitor/survey:

    * Age structure of plants
    * Number of seedlings.      


Management Rationale and Projects
=================================


Regeneration
---------------------------------
A population of six has been increased to 33 plants by the introduction of plants grown in cultivation. Propagation of plants will be continued in cultivation, but translocation into the wild will cease until taxonomic and genetic studies determine its status.

Projects:

* Undertake genetic research to clarify the taxonomy of the species.
* Undertake ecological research to develop a better understanding of the species.
* If found to be an established introduction, monitor the effects of the existing 33 plants (and progeny) on the native flora.
* Identify, map and safeguard potentially suitable sites.


Invasive species
---------------------------------
* Promote appropriate habitat management, including the control of invasive vegetation, particularly non-native cotoneasters.

Monitoring & Projects:

* Monitor and control plant arrivals at the locations of Wild Cotoneaster


Illegal collection
---------------------------------
* Ensure that local botanical groups and other relevant organisations are aware of the legal and ecological implications of collecting this species.
* The precise location of this species will remain secret because of the risk from collectors.

Monitoring & Projects:

* Monitor location for signs of disturbance
* Conceal the plants whereabouts.
* Ensure that offenders are prosecuted


Grazing
---------------------------------
Grazing by feral goats, sheep or rabbits may hinder regeneration.

Monitor:

* Grazing by goats, and sheep, by faecal analysis and observation.


Erosion/damage
---------------------------------
Damage by climbers is a threat, though rock climbing is currently controlled by voluntary agreement with local clubs who co-operate with safeguarding the plant.

Monitoring & Projects:

* Monitor locations for activity of climbing


Management Options
==================

Continuously:

* A3:  Active management to maintain populations

Access:

* E2: Restricted access by permission.
