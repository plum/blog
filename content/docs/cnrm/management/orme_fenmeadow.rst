Designation
===========

Grade I SSSI, Candidate SAC, UK BAP Key Habitat status (1995).

Size:

* 0.4 ha.

Description
===========
The Calcicolous Molinia pasture-Cirsium dissectum (M24) community is found in warm conditions on moderately mesotrophic, dry, peaty soils associated with mires.

A considerable number of flowering herbs and sedges are able to maintain themselves under a frequent grazing regime, with some patched structural diversity. Sub-shrubs, Erica tetralix, Calluna vulgaris, and Ulex gallii make a slight appearance. The bryophyte cover is generally low and shade-tolerant, with inhibited development.


Current condition and status
============================

Fen Meadow:

* Total Area: 0.4 ha.
* Frequency of constant and frequent species: within LACs.
* Species indicative of change: within LAC
* A set of sub-shrubs indicative of grazing activity.


Current Status: 

Favourable Maintained, as of December 2001. This assertion is based upon the 2000/2001 survey.


Attributes selected as performance indicators
=============================================
The Fen Meadow will be considered to be in favourable condition provided the following attributes are within LACs:


Extent
----------------------------

All Fen Meadow Calcicolous Molinia - dissectum (M24 b/c)

* Component plant communities are influenced by climate and soil conditions, but this is essentially a secondary vegetation type, derived from a variety of precursors and maintained by grazing. These are not static factors and area limits are thus set.


Quality/condition
-----------------
* M24b Calcicolous Molinia pasture-Cirsium dissectum sub-community
* M24c Juncus acutiflorus-Erica Tetralix sub-community
* Grass sward height
* A set of sub-shrubs indicative of grazing activity
* A set of associated plants as indicators of change.


Attributes and Operational Limits
=================================

Objective statement
-----------------------
To maintain the Fen Meadow with its usual plants in favourable condition, WHERE:


Extent
-----------------
All Fen Meadow

* Total area remains at the target level.
* Target level: 0.4 ha. of 323 ha
* Upper limit: None set
* Lower limit: target level.
* Monitor/surveillance:
    * Extent of Fen Meadow


Condition
---------  

All existing NVC plant communities:

* Target:	The following conditions are met in 95% by extent
* Lower limit: 70%
* Upper limit: none set.


M24b Calcicolous Molinia pasture-Cirsium dissectum sub-community
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Monitor:  frequency of Calcicolous Molinia and Cirsium dissectum
* Upper and lower limits: As stated in NVC floristic tables


M24c Juncus acutiflorus-Erica Tetralix sub-community
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Monitor	frequency of Juncus acutiflorus-Erica Tetralix
* Upper and lower limits: 	 As stated in NVC floristic tables


Grass sward height: is maintained between limits

* Target: Maintain limits to grass height
* Upper limit: 	60 cm.
* Lower limit: 	20 cm
* Monitor: Sward height


A set of sub-shrubs indicative of grazing activity

* These sub-shrubs are kept in check by adequate grazing regime.
* Monitor:
    * *Erica tetralix, Calluna vulgaris, and Ulex gallii*
* Upper limit: cover = 10%


A set of associated plants as indicators of change:

* Monitor: frequency of:
    * Angelica sylvestris, Cirsium palustre, Schoenus nigricans, Hypericum undulatum, viola dioica, Deschampsia cespitosa, Festuca rubra,Carex panicea


Management Rationale and Projects
=================================

All factors, grazing and threats 1 to 9, Calcicolous Grassland
----------------------------------------------------------------
Those found  the Management Rationale and Projects in the feature, Calcicolous Grassland, are relevant, and refer equally to Fen Meadow, with the following exceptions:

Grazing intensity

* Typical sward height tends to be taller in Fen meadow than in calcicolous grassland. The grazing regime here needs to be specifically monitored for effects upon sward height. Associated sub-shrubs Erica tetralix, Calluna vulgaris, and Ulex gallii are kept in check by an adequate grazing regime.


Operational limits: (refer to Quality indicators)

Projects:

* Target grazing as necessary to maintain sward height and control sub-shrubs.


Management Options
==================
Continuously:

* A3:   Active management to maintain Fen Meadow
* E4:   Open access. Request walkers stay on paths.
